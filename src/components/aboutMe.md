I'm an aspiring web developer looking to help you create beautiful and functional websites. My academic focus was in Software Engineering which has grown my skills involving all stacks of development. When I'm not coding, you can find me reading, playing table tennis, or spending time with friends and family. Want to help me grow? My resume can be found at the bottom of this page.
